This repository contains the code and resources for the Iris Flower Classification project, completed as part of my machine learning internship with DIGITALBHEM. The project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species using two popular machine learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Decision Trees.

üåü Project Overview
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, featuring 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample consists of four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify the Iris species based on these features.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Standardize the features to improve algorithm performance.
2. Model Training
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Train a k-NN classifier with k=5.
Decision Tree: Train a Decision Tree classifier with default parameters.
3. Model Evaluation
Calculate accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
Generate confusion matrices and classification reports for detailed model evaluation.
4. Data Visualization
Create confusion matrix heatmaps for both classifiers.
Visualize feature distributions and relationships using pair plots.
üìà Results
Both the k-NN and Decision Tree classifiers achieved perfect accuracy on the test set, demonstrating their effectiveness on the Iris dataset. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations provide further insights into model performance.
